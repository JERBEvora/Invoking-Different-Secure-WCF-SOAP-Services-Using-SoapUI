# Invoking Different Secure WCF SOAP Services using SoapUI
Sample for (www.jeevora.com) posts about Invoking Different Secure WCF SOAP Services using SoapUI - Part I, II, III  (https://www.jeevora.com/2020/03/31/invoking-secure-wcf-soap-service-using-soap-ui-part1/

In this series divided into three-part, I will demonstrate how to use the SoapUI API tool to invoke a secured WCF SOAP service. The first post will focus on creating a service where it will be the system under test. The second post will approach the steps required to invoke it while secured by a basic authentication mechanism. And in the last part, I will make a slight change to the initial service, allowing it to be guarded by the certificate authentication mechanism. In this same post, I will demonstrate how to invoke it using SoapUI as well.
